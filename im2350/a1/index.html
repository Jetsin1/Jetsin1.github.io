       <h1>Interactive Media: Assignment 1: goodbye.monster</h1>

    <h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>

      <p>The color scheme of the website and the simplistic design of the first opening page of the website as well as 
        the retro button and contrasting colours aesthetic. Everything was very dark and minimal and where other normal websites usually have images or icons to help navigate the website,
      this first opening experience was just the pure pink text that said "GOODBYE.MONSTER".</p>


    <h3>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

     <p>This is a timed 2 minutes of the experience and a list of each of my discrete actions: </p>

    <ol>
      <li> The first was reading the unnatural and unfamiliar text layout and color scheme contrast and left-clicking the 'Just Visiting' button.</li>
      <li>I left-clicked on the button 'you are someone'</li>
      <li>I left-clicked on preferences and messed around to see what kind of settings I could change</li>
      <li>Read through the first set of text and left-clicked on 'Lie Here'</li>
      <li>I then left-clicked the 'recall the past button' that then made a purple bar show up on the right of the text</li>
      <li>I left-clicked on the bar first trying to figure out what it was then I realised it was just a scroll bar after holding the left click and dragging it up and down.</li>
      <li>I continued and left-clicked the 'stand' button</li>
      <li>The page got bigger and I used the scroll wheel to scroll up and down to see what was different</li>
      <li>2 new buttons appeared, one was a fixed text button and another was 4 square moving boxes as a clickable button, I left-clicked the moving boxes first.</li>
      <li>I left-clicked and dragged the boxes that opened up into some kind of mind map and nothing happened</li>
      <li>I then left-clicked the offer button and it said that 'I had nothing to offer' </li>
      <li>I left-clicked the 'A Stagnant puddle button' that led me to two more buttons</li>
      <li>I swiftly left-clicked both brought up two sets of texts at the same time (I realise I was supposed to left-click them one at a time)</li>
      <li>I left-clicked and took both of the items</li>
      <li>I left-clicked the floating boxes and left clicked offer button once again</li>
      <li>I left-clicked and offered the leaves and the whole menu changes for the floating boxes</li>
      <li>I try to left-click and drag the moving boxes but nothing happens other than when I hover on top of the boxes</li>
      <li>I left clicked the poke button</li>
      <li>I left clicked the rest button</li>
      <li>I left-clicked the 'think' button 4 times and it just kept generating random combinations of names</li>
      <li>I finally clicked nod and chose a random name</li>
      <li>I then left-clicked and chose a random name for myself</li>
      <li>I get another option on the left to get out of the hole and I left click that and end up in the poison swamp</li>
    </ol>



    <h3>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

      <p>The most time I spent engaging in the experience was with the monster. It was its own clickable and moving entity that would follow me throughout the entire game so I would constantly return back to the monster and
      offer it whatever item I would pick up, I would also continuously poke it for fun whenever I would get bored.</p>

    <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

    <p>My most common action was just left-clicking throughout the entire process, I had to occasionally scroll up and down but my main interaction to progress forwards within the website was just left clicking.</p>

    <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

    <p>I believe the intended primary goal of the website was to make it into an interactive RPG game, it was to allow the user to go through a story-driven option based game.</p>

    <h3>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

    <p>I think it could've been more interactive rather than just constantly left-clicking through because it does get extremely repetitive. The developers of the website could've maybe used more ways of input from the mouse or the keyboard and it also could've used more sound effects too.</p>

    <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

    <p> The interactive experience over time gets far too repetitive for me. The first 4 minutes just to get to the poison swamp already gets too repetitive with just reading and left clicking constantly. It gets too boring too quickly.</p>

    <h3>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

      <p>It starts off from the very beginning of the opening screen and its entire theme of how it will be interacted with, this way of communicating is just simply 'click to proceed' in the most dull and simplitically boring way possible./p>

    <h3>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

      <p>The media form this represents is a gaming RPG experience it is trying to mimic the story-based choice gameplay through a website. An example of games this website is a close reference to is games like 'Undertale' where you try and proceed through the story of the game.</p>

    <h3>10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

      <p>How I should act is to be prepared for anything like boss fights and like interactions as well as moving through the game trying every input and option of possibility to discover things that may be hidden from plane sight.</p>

    <h3>11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

      <p>The way how a player such as myself should feel during games is the feeling of having fun whilst being challenged in a way that isn't too hard nor too easy that way I won't lose focus or get bored of the game. This feeling of excitement also comes into play with build ups of
        large inputs challenging one's skill and perseverence at times as well. This is all thanks to the multiple inputs that other games allow unlike this singular left click only website experience.
      </p>

    <h3>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

      <p>The inconsistency of the button placements and how easy it is to get lost within this website. The location of the back button would never be in the same place for anything else, it was always different.
        Not to mention the fact that this entire website felt like a maze to navigate through and the majority of the locations were all useless. I also wished that there was a better variety of colour to help differentiate different things in the website.
        I understand that there is a certain type of aesthetic chosen for this website however that does not mean that the developer of the site is unable to make to where the colours variety could actually help the user navigate through the website better. If not then just use more Icons rather than text,
        words get incredibly boring and repetitive over time, this is a game, not a book. I understand that maybe the story may be the main experience but what good is a story if its incredibly dull to go through everything.
      </p>

    <h3>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
      
      <p>I believe the most satisfying part of the interaction to me was just the monster, being able to communicate and interact with it like poking it or offering it items really adds a nice touch and makes it feel just that little bit more alive when interactive with the website.</p>
